# create-apollo-graphql

It's could be boilerplate to create GraphQL application on both node.js server app and single spa client app.

Here we developed a node.js CLI which try to make developer's life much easier.

Create Apollo Graphql Server / Client apps with no build configuration.

Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Why Apollo GraphQL

Most popular among all those GraphQL frameworks: [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) / [Bit](https://github.com/teambit/bit) / [Relay](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js) / [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/with-graphql/) [...](https://blog.bitsrc.io/13-graphql-tools-and-libraries-you-should-know-in-2019-e4b9005f6fc2)

Provide both Server side and Client side [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) template implementation with seamless integration, better suite our domain driven design architecture

Apollo Server datasource can easily integrate with our RESTFul and JSON-RPC api, separate authentication concern from BE JSON-RPC implementation

Apollo Client has default implementation using React, amazing feature like hooks / render props / cache policy out of box make FE integration simple and stupid(KISS)
